Description:
The Shopping Demo App project is a comprehensive iOS application designed to showcase best practices in iOS development, integrating various key features and design patterns. This project is structured around a product listing application, emphasizing the implementation of essential components.

Key Features:

Login Screen: The application incorporates a secure login screen, ensuring a seamless and protected user authentication process.

Login API Integration: Utilizing URL sessions, the app communicates with a login API, enhancing security and connecting seamlessly with backend services.

Table View: The user interface is built using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern, with a dynamic table view to display the list of products.

URL Session and Decodable Protocol: Network requests are handled through URLSession, and data is parsed using the Decodable protocol along with a JSON decoder for efficient and clean data retrieval.

Image Downloading with Kingfisher Library: The Kingfisher library is employed for downloading and caching images, providing a smooth user experience and optimized performance.

CocoaPods Integration: The project utilizes CocoaPods to manage dependencies, streamlining the integration of third-party libraries like Kingfisher.

Custom UI with XIB for Enumerated UITableViewCells: To enhance modularity and reusability, custom UITableViewCells are designed using XIB files, implementing an enumerated design for a consistent and visually appealing user interface.

Completion Handlers and Closures: The application leverages completion handlers and closures to manage asynchronous operations, ensuring responsiveness and efficient handling of data.

Data Passing: Seamless data passing between different components of the app is facilitated, allowing for a cohesive user experience and streamlined information flow.

Pull-to-Refresh: Users can easily refresh the displayed product list through a pull-to-refresh mechanism, enhancing the real-time nature of the application.

User Defaults: User preferences and settings are stored using UserDefaults, providing a persistent and user-friendly experience.
