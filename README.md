Description:
The Shopping Demo App project is a comprehensive iOS application designed to showcase best practices in iOS development, integrating various key features and design patterns. This project is structured around a product listing application, emphasizing the implementation of essential components.

Key Features:

Login Screen: The application incorporates a secure login screen, ensuring a seamless and protected user authentication process.

Login API Integration: Utilizing URL sessions, the app communicates with a login API, enhancing security and connecting seamlessly with backend services.

Table View: The user interface is built using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern, with a dynamic table view to display the list of products.

URL Session and Decodable Protocol: Network requests are handled through URLSession, and data is parsed using the Decodable protocol along with a JSON decoder for efficient and clean data retrieval.

Image Downloading with Kingfisher Library: The Kingfisher library is employed for downloading and caching images, providing a smooth user experience and optimized performance.

CocoaPods Integration: The project utilizes CocoaPods to manage dependencies, streamlining the integration of third-party libraries like Kingfisher.
